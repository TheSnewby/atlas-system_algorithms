# Atlas System Algorithms

A set of complex data structures and algorithms designed for efficient performance of software. I found the data structures refreshing and the algorithms to use them quite complex.

## Description

* Graphs are great data structure for storing non hierchical data.
* Huffman coding is a capable compression and decompression algorithms using bitwise memory storage.
* N-ary trees provide the capability of storing non-binary hierchical data cleverly using a nonstandard binary tree.
* Pathfinding is a set of clever search algorithms for graphs including the infamous Dijkstra's Algorithm.
* Red-black trees guarantee logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion and deletion.
